# Library-database
The objective of this project is to develop a database that caters to the management of library activities. The database is expected to be efficient, user-friendly, and capable of managing large volumes of data. This database is designed to meet the requirements set out by the client, which includes storing member information, library items, loan history, and fine payments. The project shows prowess in the use database objects such as stored procedures, user-defined functions (UDF), views, triggers, joins, SQL queries, and nested queries. 
The client has also requested the database to be in third normal form which will require creating multiple tables, relationships, constraints, and permissions. The database is designed using Transact Structured Query Language (T-SQL), while Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MS-SSMS) will serve as the development environment.
